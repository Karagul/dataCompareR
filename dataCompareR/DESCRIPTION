Description: dataCompareR aims to make it easy to compare two tabular data
    objects in R. It's specifically designed to show differences between two sets of
    data in a useful way that should make it easier to understand the differences,
    and if necessary, help you work out how to remedy them. In this regard, it aims
    to offer a more useful output than `all.equal` when your two datasets do not
    match, but isn't intended to replace `all.equal` as a way to test for equality.
